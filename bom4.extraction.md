Summary : This is a technical engineering assembly drawing for a "Polea Cable" (Cable Pulley), showing a cross-sectional view of the assembly with labeled components and a bill of materials (BOM) table listing part names, quantities, and materials.

technical engineering drawing:
# Cross-Sectional Assembly View :
  • The main view is a cross-section of a mechanical assembly, showing internal and external features.
  • Ten components are labeled with circled numbers (1–10), each pointing to a specific part in the assembly.
  • Visible features include a pulley wheel, shaft, support brackets, fasteners, and a base plate.
  • Section lines indicate cut surfaces for clarity of internal structure.

# Bill of Materials (BOM) Table :
  • Table lists 10 items, each with columns for item number, quantity, description, and material.
  • Example entries:
    – 10: "PLACA DE FIJACION", material: "F-350"
    – 9: "GRAPA M-14", material: "DIN 128"
    – 8: "TORNILLO HEX. M14 x 65", material: "8.8"
    – 7: "TANDELA", material: "F-350"
    – 6: "EJE", material: "F-350"
    – 5: "CASQUILLO", material: "F-1110"
    – 4: "RUEDA", material: "F-1250"
    – 3: "SOPORTE ESTRCHO", material: "F-350"
    – 2: "SOPORTE IZQ/DERO", material: "F-350"
    – 1: "PLACA BASE", material: "F-350"
  • Each item has a quantity (e.g., 1 or 2).

# Title Block :
  • Title: "POLEA CABLE"
  • Drawing type: "PLANO DE CONJUNTO" (Assembly Drawing)
  • Scale: 1:1.00
  • Drawing number: "L00"
  • Company/brand: "MARIPU"
  • Additional fields for designer, date, and approval (some are filled, some blank).

# Annotations & Details :
  • Section lines, leader lines, and hatching indicate material cuts and part boundaries.
  • Spanish language is used throughout.
  • Some dimensions and technical notes are present but not fully legible in the image.

# Analysis :
  • The drawing provides a complete overview of the cable pulley assembly, with clear identification of each part and its material.
  • The cross-sectional view allows for understanding of internal relationships and assembly order.
  • The BOM ensures traceability and aids in manufacturing or maintenance.
  • The use of standardized parts (e.g., hex bolts, washers) is evident.
  • The drawing is suitable for fabrication, assembly, and quality control purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.008,t=0.009,r=0.993,b=0.991), with ID 38b826ce-58e8-4755-9290-e39a84fa670b -->
