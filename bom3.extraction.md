Summary : This figure presents a detailed technical drawing and exploded assembly diagram of a mechanical component consisting of four spring-loaded assemblies mounted on a cross-shaped base, with labeled parts and precise dimensional annotations.

technical drawing and exploded assembly diagram:
# Orthographic Views :
  • Top-left: Overhead view showing four identical spring assemblies arranged in a cross pattern around a central hub.
  • Bottom-left: Side elevation view of the four spring assemblies mounted on the cross-shaped base.
  • Dimensions provided: 20 ± .002 mm (distance between spring centers), 51 ± .01 mm (overall width), 18.5 ± .05 mm (height from base to top of spring).

# Exploded Assembly View :
  • Top-right: 3D exploded diagram showing all components separated for clarity.
  • Components labeled as J1 (cross-shaped base), J2 (washer), J3 (nut), J4 (cylindrical pin), J5 (cylindrical sleeve), and four identical spring assemblies.
  • Each spring assembly consists of a helical spring, washers, and nuts.

# Part Labels and Annotations :
  • J1: Cross-shaped base plate with central hole.
  • J2: Washer.
  • J3: Nut.
  • J4: Cylindrical pin/rod.
  • J5: Cylindrical sleeve with a side cutout.
  • All parts are shown in exploded alignment, indicating assembly order.

# Dimensional Details :
  • Key dimensions: 20 ± .002 mm (center-to-center spacing), 51 ± .01 mm (overall width), 18.5 ± .05 mm (height).
  • Tolerances are specified for precision assembly.

# Analysis :
  • The figure provides a comprehensive visual and dimensional reference for assembling the spring-loaded mechanism.
  • The exploded view clarifies the order and orientation of each part, while the orthographic projections ensure accurate fabrication and assembly.
  • The use of tight tolerances suggests the assembly is intended for precise mechanical function, likely requiring careful alignment of the spring assemblies on the base. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.123,r=0.676,b=0.921), with ID 29200221-e42e-471a-aeb8-2f9a68d3f542 -->
